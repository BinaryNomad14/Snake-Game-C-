# Snake Game in C++

## Project Overview
This project is a modern implementation of the classic Snake game developed in **C++** as a part of our college assignment. The game showcases advanced use of **linked lists**, **dynamic memory management**, and platform-independent console handling techniques.

### Key Features
- **Smooth Gameplay:** The snake moves smoothly with dynamic growth upon consuming food.
- **Special Food:** Occasionally, special food appears, granting higher points.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Choose from three modes: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- **Collision Handling:** Game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- **High Score Tracking:** Track your highest score throughout the session.
- **Platform Support:** Works on both **Windows** and **Unix-based** systems.

## How to Play
- **Controls:**
  - **W:** Move Up
  - **S:** Move Down
  - **A:** Move Left
  - **D:** Move Right
- **Objective:** Guide the snake to consume food (@) and special food ($) to earn points and grow longer.
- **Game Over Conditions:**
  - Collision with the game boundary.
  - Collision with the snake's body.

### Scoring
- Regular Food: **10 points**
- Special Food: **50 points**

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy:** Slow snake speed.
- **Medium:** Moderate snake speed.
- **Hard:** Fast snake speed.

## Data Structures 
We have used Linked List for the snake's body as Linked Lists allocate memory dynamically. As in our logic we need to add Head and remove Tail form the end (if the snake does not grow in size), Linked Lists help us do that in least time as they have Time Complexity O(1) for adding and deleting node at head or end.

We have used pairs for food to assign them X and Y co-oridnates.

## Installation and Setup
### Windows
1. Ensure that **MinGW** or any compatible C++ compiler is installed.
2. Compile and run the game:
   ```bash
   g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake_game.exe
   .\snake_game.exe
   ```

### Unix-based Systems (Linux/Mac)
1. Open the terminal.
2. Compile and run the game:
   ```bash
   g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake_game
   ./snake_game
   ```

## Project Structure
- `Node`: Represents a segment of the snake.
- `Snake`: Manages the snake's movement, growth, and collision handling.
- `Game`: Handles game logic, rendering, and player input.
- `main()`: Entry point for the game.

---

## Technical Highlights
- **Dynamic Linked List:** The snake is implemented using a linked list where each node represents a segment.
- **Platform-Independent Console Handling:** Utilizes platform-specific functions to handle keyboard inputs and screen clearing.
- **Randomized Special Food Generation:** The special food is placed at random intervals and positions.
- **Memory Management:** Proper dynamic memory allocation and deallocation ensure efficient resource usage.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add **obstacles** to increase gameplay difficulty.
- Implement **sound effects** for events.
- Create a **graphical version** using libraries like **SFML**.
- Introduce **multiplayer mode**.
